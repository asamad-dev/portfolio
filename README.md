## 📝 Important Note

**NDA & Confidentiality:** Due to non-disclosure agreements with enterprise clients (JPMorgan Chase, Trilogy/Crossover, Educative), this portfolio focuses on **technical approaches, architectural patterns, and quantifiable business outcomes** rather than proprietary code or confidential business logic. All project descriptions represent actual work delivered in production environments.

**Code Samples:** Independent AI projects contain actual implementation code, while enterprise projects emphasize architecture and methodology.
